 *
 * LoRaWAN¬Æ Application Layer Clock Synchronization Specification, authored by the FUOTA Working Group of the
 * LoRa Alliance¬Æ Technical Committee, proposes an application layer messaging package running over LoRaWAN¬Æ
 * to synchronize the real-time clock of an end-device to the network‚Äôs GPS clock with second accuracy.
 *
 * This package is useful for end-devices which do not have access to other accurate time source.
 * An end-device using LoRaWAN 1.1 or above SHOULD use DeviceTimeReq MAC command instead of this package.
 * ClassB end-devices have a more efficient way of synchronizing their clock, the classB network beacon. They
 * SHOULD NOT use this package and directly use the beacon time information.
 * End-devices with an accurate external clock source (e.g.: GPS) SHOULD use that clock source instead.
 *
 * Remark: Since GPS clock sources can be jammed or spoofed, this package can be used for secure time distribution.
